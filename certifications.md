# SAYU — Real English Practice Through Conversation

**Type**: Independent Startup Project  
**Timeline**: 2025 – Present  
**Role**: Founder / Content Strategist

## Overview

SAYU is a cross-cultural English practice service designed to help non-native speakers become fluent through natural conversation — not lessons or textbooks. The brand was developed and tested using the Red Note (小红书) platform to build trust, attract users, and differentiate from traditional tutoring models.

This project focuses on helping users improve real-life English speaking confidence through short-form content, 1-on-1 chat sessions, and brand storytelling across Chinese and Western platforms.

## Concept

Unlike standard tutoring, SAYU positions itself as a “language gym” — where users don’t learn more English, they **use** the English they already know. The core message: **“Practice > Theory.”**

Content emphasizes:
- Real conversational practice
- Native speaker feedback
- No pressure, no tests
- Cultural nuance and modern expressions

## My Responsibilities

- Developed the brand strategy, name, and tone (English + Chinese)
- Built two Red Note profiles: one personal brand, one business-facing
- Designed short-form video and image content using CapCut and Canva
- Wrote bilingual posts promoting practice sessions, trials, and tips
- Created scripts, bio links, and visual identity for credibility and trust
- Researched user needs and pricing models by testing post formats

## Outcomes

- Established a professional presence on Red Note targeting Chinese learners  
- Created content calendar, bilingual assets, and onboarding funnel for new users  
- Differentiated from typical online English services through positioning and tone  
- Built groundwork for scalable paid sessions via WeChat and QR-linked signup
