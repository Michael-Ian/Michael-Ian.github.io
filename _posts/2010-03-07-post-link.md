# Hi, I'm Michael

I'm a marketing graduate with a passion for cross-cultural communication, social media strategy, and building creative campaigns. Raised in Canada and having spent time living in China, I focus on connecting ideas across different languages, cultures, and platforms.

This portfolio is a collection of my work from professional research projects to certification-based learning and personal branding efforts.
