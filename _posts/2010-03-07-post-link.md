# Welcome to My Portfolio

I’m a marketing grad who believes language and culture are the most powerful tools in communication.  
I was raised in Canada, spent time living in China, and now I help bridge both worlds through bilingual content and strategy.

Whether you're a brand trying to grow or a person looking for connection, I’m here to help ideas come to life — creatively and clearly.
