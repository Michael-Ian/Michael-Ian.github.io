# Neuston Biosystems — Market Research Project

**Type**: Industry-Sponsored Consulting Project  
**Duration**: January – April 2025  
**Role**: Marketing Research Analyst

## Overview

As part of a consulting engagement with Neuston Biosystems, a Toronto-based CleanTech and AgTech startup, I worked on a market research project to explore the product-market fit for a new wastewater remediation technology. The company’s innovation focuses on sustainable whey waste treatment that also produces valuable byproducts such as animal feed and biofertilizer.

## Scope

The objective was to understand the current whey management practices of Ontario-based cheese producers and determine if Neuston’s algae-based treatment system could serve as a viable alternative. The work contributed to both product development and strategic marketing direction.

## Responsibilities

- Conducted market research through interviews with operational leaders and decision-makers at dairy and cheese production facilities across Ontario.
- Gathered and analyzed data on whey disposal practices, costs, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory compliance.
- Created detailed customer personas and identified industry-specific pain points, with emphasis on phosphorus removal, environmental discharge limits, and labor/resource constraints.
- Evaluated competing solutions, including current whey trucking, biodigestor systems, and off-site agricultural reuse.
- Developed actionable marketing recommendations and contributed to a strategy report that included:
  - Product specification requirements
  - Ideal pricing models
  - Go-to-market insights
  - Stakeholder engagement plans
- Delivered final results in the form of a comprehensive industry report and presentation deck.

## Outcomes

- Provided Neuston with validated insight into potential early adopters and realistic market challenges.
- Contributed to the creation of data-informed feature priorities for product development.
- Supported client fundraising efforts with Letters of Intent from industry stakeholders and environmental impact data.

# SAYU — Real English Practice Through Conversation

**Type**: Independent Startup Project  
**Timeline**: 2025 – Present  
**Role**: Founder / Content Strategist

## Overview

SAYU is a cross-cultural English practice service designed to help non-native speakers become fluent through natural conversation — not lessons or textbooks. The brand was developed and tested using the Red Note (小红书) platform to build trust, attract users, and differentiate from traditional tutoring models.

This project focuses on helping users improve real-life English speaking confidence through short-form content, 1-on-1 chat sessions, and brand storytelling across Chinese and Western platforms.

## Concept

Unlike standard tutoring, SAYU positions itself as a “language gym” — where users don’t learn more English, they **use** the English they already know. The core message: **“Practice > Theory.”**

Content emphasizes:
- Real conversational practice
- Native speaker feedback
- No pressure, no tests
- Cultural nuance and modern expressions

## My Responsibilities

- Developed the brand strategy, name, and tone (English + Chinese)
- Built two Red Note profiles: one personal brand, one business-facing
- Designed short-form video and image content using CapCut and Canva
- Wrote bilingual posts promoting practice sessions, trials, and tips
- Created scripts, bio links, and visual identity for credibility and trust
- Researched user needs and pricing models by testing post formats

## Outcomes

- Established a professional presence on Red Note targeting Chinese learners  
- Created content calendar, bilingual assets, and onboarding funnel for new users  
- Differentiated from typical online English services through positioning and tone  
- Built groundwork for scalable paid sessions via WeChat and QR-linked signup
