# Neuston Biosystems — Market Research Project

**Type**: Industry-Sponsored Consulting Project  
**Duration**: January – April 2025  
**Role**: Marketing Research Analyst

## Overview

As part of a consulting engagement with Neuston Biosystems, a Toronto-based CleanTech and AgTech startup, I worked on a market research project to explore the product-market fit for a new wastewater remediation technology. The company’s innovation focuses on sustainable whey waste treatment that also produces valuable byproducts such as animal feed and biofertilizer.

## Scope

The objective was to understand the current whey management practices of Ontario-based cheese producers and determine if Neuston’s algae-based treatment system could serve as a viable alternative. The work contributed to both product development and strategic marketing direction.

## Responsibilities

- Conducted market research through interviews with operational leaders and decision-makers at dairy and cheese production facilities across Ontario.
- Gathered and analyzed data on whey disposal practices, costs, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory compliance.
- Created detailed customer personas and identified industry-specific pain points, with emphasis on phosphorus removal, environmental discharge limits, and labor/resource constraints.
- Evaluated competing solutions, including current whey trucking, biodigestor systems, and off-site agricultural reuse.
- Developed actionable marketing recommendations and contributed to a strategy report that included:
  - Product specification requirements
  - Ideal pricing models
  - Go-to-market insights
  - Stakeholder engagement plans
- Delivered final results in the form of a comprehensive industry report and presentation deck.

## Outcomes

- Provided Neuston with validated insight into potential early adopters and realistic market challenges.
- Contributed to the creation of data-informed feature priorities for product development.
- Supported client fundraising efforts with Letters of Intent from industry stakeholders and environmental impact data.
