### Welcome to the Psychology Department at Smith College
> "Psychology at Smith is consistently one of the most popular majors on campus. The departmentâ€™s faculty is strongly committed to providing a rich, diverse curriculum to majors and nonmajors alike. Our mission is to develop skills that will serve students well in psychology but that can also be applied in other important arenas, including writing and communication skills, hands-on training and multicultural fluency. We emphasize student participation in research; faculty-student collaboration and mentoring; and preparation and guidance for future studies in psychology and related fields." -- Smith College Website, Academics, Psychology Department
