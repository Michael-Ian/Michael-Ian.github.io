I’m Michael a marketing graduate from Toronto, Canada with a strong interest in strategy, content, and cross-cultural communication. Raised in Canada and having lived in China, I bring a bilingual perspective to everything I do. My focus is helping ideas travel clearly between audiences, platforms, and markets.
