## About
I'm a Ph.D. applied mathematician.
I have worked as a researcher, teacher, and software engineer.
My favorite problems have both deep mathematical and practical implications.
A long time interest has been fluid dynamics and its related mathematical and computational challenges.
I am more generally interested in the analysis and numerical analysis of PDE, especially for nonlinear problems.
These interests have led to me to work on wide variety of problems.
