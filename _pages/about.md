Hi! My name is Rodrigo Hernangómez and
I was born and raised in Madrid, where I also got my M.Sc.
in Telecommunication Engineering from the
[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](http://www.upm.es/internacional).

Currently I am pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the
[Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/)
while working as a research assistant for the
[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunication, Heinrich Hertz Institute](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/).

As a research assistant, I am involved in
public and private projects with several partners.
Among them I would like to cite 
[Infineon Technologies AG](https://www.infineon.com/),
which I have been closely working with since 2018.

My research interests include machine and deep learning,
Bayesian statistics, information theory and signal processing,
specially in application to the fields of radar and
wireless communication.

Apart from this, I am also deeply interested in other topics
dealing with digital art, music information retrieval and
image and sound. Most of my personal projects fall under
these topics, while the former ones are covered by my professional
and research activities.

You can also find me on
[TU Berlin's site](https://www.netit.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/extern/hernangomez/)
and
[Google scholar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo_Hernangomez).

Any questions? Do not hesitate to [contact me](../contact).
