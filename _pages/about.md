Hi! My name is Rodrigo Hernangómez and
I was born and raised in Madrid, where I also got my M.Sc.
in Telecommunication Engineering from the
[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](http://www.upm.es/internacional).

Currently I am pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the
[Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/)
while working as a research associate for the
[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunication, Heinrich Hertz Institute](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/).

For an overview of my research activities and projects, do not forget to check the
[research page](../research).

Apart from those, I am also deeply interested in other topics
dealing with digital art, music information retrieval and
image and sound. As a matter of fact, most of the content you can find
on this site is related to these.

You can also find me on
[TU Berlin's site](https://www.netit.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/extern/hernangomez/)
and
[Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo_Hernangomez).

**Any questions?** Do not hesitate to [contact me](../contact).
