## Current
I am a senior research scientist at Geometric Data Analytics, Durham, NC.
I have contributed to and lead projects involving mathematical approaches to data science and machine learning. 
These have included work on geometric and topological data analysis and deep reinforcement learning.

I have overseen both research and software teams working on ML applications.
I am comfortable working to rapidly develop ML applications from mathematics, to algorithm, to implementation, to deployment, to results.
