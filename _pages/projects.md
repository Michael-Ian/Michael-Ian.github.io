These are some of the personal projects I have been up to. Make sure to check them out on
[GitHub]({{site.github.owner_url}}) as well.

My writing style within the projects always aims at a _simple-to-complex_ narrative, so I try to start with
the more **artistic**, easy-to-digest ideas for the general audience and I get increasingly **technical**
towards the end to
content also my fellow scientists and engineers.

I even separate art and technique physically with a
**double horizontal line**, so that in case you lack the background you have a warning signal
of the moment you are allowed to jump out of the boat.
