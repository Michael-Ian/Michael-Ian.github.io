My research interests include machine and deep learning,
Bayesian statistics, information theory and signal processing,
specially in application to the fields of radar and
wireless communication.

Since 2018, I have been lucky enough to join forces with some
leading companies in the semiconductor and telecommunications sectors
in order to carry out my research.
From 2018 to 2021, I collaborated closely with
[Infineon Technologies AG](https://www.infineon.com/)
in their commercial
[radar sensors](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/60GHz/),
which you can find for instance in
[Google Pixel 4](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4).

### Projects

As a research associate at the
[Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/),
I am involved in several
public and private research projects, including the following ones:

* [OrtoFern3D](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/wn/projects/archive/ortofern3d.html) ---
Precise 3D-Localization System for Wireless Controllers in District Heating Networks.
* [AI4Mobile](https://www.ai4mobile.org/en/) ---
AI-aided Wireless Systems for Mobility in Industry and Traffic.
* [6G-RIC](https://6g-ric.de/en) --- Germany-wide Research and Innovation Cluster for 6G mobile technologies.
