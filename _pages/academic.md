## How to declare a major/minor

  - Ask one of your Psychology instructors to be your adviser
     - Some professors may be at advisee capacity and unable to take you on at that time. Don't be intimidated to ask and don't take it personally if they say no!
       
  - Contact the Psychology Department Assistant Laura Fountain-Cincotta (lfountaincincotta@smith.edu) asking to be paired with an adviser

## Broadening your horizons: Other paths of study

Many students find that the psychology major is enhanced by learning in other departments, whether it be through taking other courses, declaring a minor, or declaring a second major.

Common departments often paired with psychology:

- **Statistical and Data Science**
    - Major in SDS
    - Major in Mathematical Statistics
    - Minor in SDS
    - Minor in Applied Statistics 

- **Education and Child Study**
    - Major in EDC
    - Minor in EDC

- **Computer Science**
    - Major in CSC
    - Minor in CSC

- **Neuroscience**
    - Major in Neuroscience
    - Minor in Neuroscience

Many students will complete coursework, a minor, or a major in a foreign language.

## Honors Thesis in Psychology

The departmental honors thesis is for senior psychology majors interested in conducting independent research on a particular topic. Honors students work closely with a faculty member to conceptualize, design, and conduct an empirical research project. Please note: faculty members from outside the Smith Psychology department are not eligible to serve as thesis advisers; the principal adviser of a psychology honors thesis must be a Smith Psychology Department faculty member. The project culminates in a paper that is equivalent to a publishable journal article in quality and length (i.e., about 30-50 pages of text and written in APA style). At the end of the academic year, Honors students present their projects to the department as a whole. Successful completion of an Honors thesis leads to departmental honors upon graduation.
