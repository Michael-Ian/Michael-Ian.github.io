Hi! Welcome to **Science of Uselessness**.
This is a personal website I have created to give exposure to some
[engineering-meets-art ideas](projects) I have developed in my free time.

I hope you find some cool project here and
[you reach me out](contact) for feedback, appreciation, clarification and so on.

Have fun!
